# DNFtranslate

Put DNFtranslate.exe and translated.txt (if you want to translate to English) in your "Do Not Fall - Run for Your Drink" folder.

The game uses the text\jap\global.lxb file to store the Japanese text.  This will be modified to your translated language.

To Translate to English - Select Use text\eng

Select Create File to backup and then modify the text\jap\global.lxb file.

Press Process and wait for it to complete.  The game should now be translated.

For other languages, delete/rename the English translated.txt file.
For now turn off Create File.
Select use translated.txt, or if you want to translate to Chinese (Traditional) select Use text\cht.  This will translate some items.
Press Process and wait for it to complete.
Text to be translated will be displayed in the program window under "Missing Text to Translate."
Translate this with your favouite translator.  I used Google.  DeepL messed up the embeded icons and would use I instead of You.
Compare the Japanese text and translation line by line.  The translator may mess up a few lines and join some together.  There should be exactly as many lines in the translated file as the original.
Save the file as translated.txt in the game directory.
Select Create File and press Process.  Wait for it to complete.  The game should now be translated.
